# Animalese Speech Synthesizer
Animalese Synthesizer is a Python-based tool that converts typed text into speech that mimics the quirky, high-pitched style of Animalese â€” the iconic voice effect used in Animal Crossing. This synthesizer builds audio by stringing together pre-recorded letter sounds, giving life to your text with an adorable, game-like personality.
