## 🎯 Features

- 🔠 Converts plain text into Animalese-style speech  
- 🎵 Uses pre-recorded sounds for character syllables  
- 🐍 Built with simple, readable Python code  
- 🔊 Real-time playback using the `playsound` module

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- `playsound`  
- `scipy`, `numpy`  
- `.wav` file handling and audio synthesis logic
